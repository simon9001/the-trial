                Jacob, you were our quiet strength and our dear brother in Christ.
As the treasurer, you kept our work steady, but it was your loving heart and your faith lived out in every small act, that held us together. You were always first to help, to pray and to encourage. Your smile brought light on the darkest days and your calm trust in God gave us courage when we felt weak.

We feel this loss in every corner of our fellowship. Yet even in our sorrow, your love stays with us. We carry you forward in the way we serve, in the way we care, in the way we lift one another up. Your life showed us that true devotion is simple, faithful, and strong.

Your memory is a blessing we will keep and share, now and always.
We love you, Jacob, we miss you every day.

Rest Well Brother.
