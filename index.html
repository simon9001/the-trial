            <h4>Early Life</h4>
            <p class="muted">Sheila Wambui, lovingly referred to as Wambo, was born in February 22nd, 1993 to her loving parents, Nancy and Francis Muiruri. Sheila was born with cerebral palsy, a condition that made her totally dependent on others for basic activities of daily living like feeding and grooming. To her loving parents, Wambo was never defined by her condition ,but by her radiant spirit, her smile and the unconditional love she gave and received. Hers was a story of resilience, warmth and quiet triumph.

              <br><br>Wambo was a loving sister to her siblings, Newton and Ian who adored her dearly. Together they shared laughter, playful moments and a bond that words can hardly capture. They delighted in her company,finding joy  in her radiant smile and in the sound of her laughter that often filled their home whenever she was around. Her parents and siblings wrapped her in unwavering affection, creating a home where she was not only cared for, but celebrated.

          <div class="event">
            <h4>Her Journey</h4>
            <p class="muted"> Wambui  was baptized  at PCEA Banana, Kiambu, at her infancy, a moment that marked her as a child of Faith and surrounded her life with grace and divine protection.That Faith became the gentle light guiding her and her family through every step of her journey.<br><br>From a tender age,Wambo began her occupational therapy journey, a path that demanded strength far beyond her years. Session after session, she faced each challenge with quiet courage and a spirit that refused to give up. Her parents stood faithfully by her side through it all, never missing a single appointment, never letting her walk that journey alone. They cheered her on during every stretch, every movement, and every small milestone, their love becoming the steady rhythm that carried her forward.
            <br><br>Wambo spent some of her life in  special schools such as SCOM Disabled Children’s Home and Training Center  in Ongata Rongai, surrounded by dedicated caregivers who nurtured her growth and honored her individuality.When the school holidays came, Wambo would  go home to the embrace of her family, where joy overflowed in every moment spent together. <br><br> Sadly,on Tuesday 21st October 2025, after a brief illness, our Baby Gal’s journey on earth ended and took a flight into eternal rest .</p>

          <div class="event">
            <h4>Her Memory</h4>
            <p class="muted">Wambui  taught us all something profound; that joy can exist in any circumstance, that love is the greatest gift we can give, and that a life lived with laughter and connection is a life well lived. Even if her body often limited her, her heart knew no limits. She lived with cerebral palsy,but  it never defined her. What defined her was her radiant smile and the boundless love she gave and received. She was a jovial soul  always ready with a giggle, a sparkle in her eyes, and a warmth that made everyone feel seen and cherished. 
              Though her physical presence is no longer with us, her spirit remains etched in our hearts, in our memories, and in the stories we will continue to tell. She was a  light that will never dim.

          <div class="event">
            <h4>Legacy</h4>
            <p class="muted">To those who cared for Wambo, thank you so so so much. Your compassion, patience, and devotion gave her a life full of dignity and delight. You were her champions, her protectors, and her friends. May God   richly bless you.

              Rest in eternal peace  dear Baby Gal. You were deeply loved and  will be forever missed.

                Sheila Wambui is the baby girl that we, the Muiruri family have lost. Our firstborn, the first fruit of my womb. <br>
                Born with cerebral palsy that rendered her totally dependent on others for care, Sheila remained the baby of the family for over 32 years. Our precious gift, our gentle joy, our constant reminder of love’s power. <br> <br>
                Our beautiful, jovial, and ever-smiling Wambu you brought sunshine into our lives.
                Your laughter, your presence, and your quiet strength filled our home with warmth and meaning. <br>
                Though caring for you came with its challenges, you were never a burden: you were our blessing. Through you, we learned patience, compassion, and the purest form of love. <br> <br>
                Our baby girl was dearly loved, and now she is missed with equal measure.
                Though you could not speak, my Sheila, you understood the language of love better than anyone. Your eyes spoke where words could not.  Your smile answered when we called your name. <br> <br>
                Every night before you slept, it was always the same: <br>
                <i>“God loves you, Wambu. Jesus loves you. Dad & Mummy loves you. Goodnight, Wambu.”</i>
                And now, my sweet girl, it is an eternal Good night. <br> <br>

                You have finished your race, my darling. You now rest in the loving arms of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, free, whole, and at peace. <br> <br>
                Fare thee well, my beautiful angel. <br>
                You will forever be my Baby Gal, <br>
                Your love will live in my heart. <br> <br>
                Until we meet again. <br> <br>
                With all our love, <br>
                Daddy & Mummy.

                Dear Wambu,<br><br>
                Seeing you again during my visit is a memory I’ll always hold close. The way we laughed, shared stories, and simply enjoyed each other’s company felt like time had stopped.<br><br>
                You had this special way of making even ordinary moments unforgettable.<br><br>
                Your laughter still echoes in my heart; warm, genuine, and full of life. You taught me the value of love, patience, and family without ever needing to say much.<br><br>
                Thank you for being the sister who always made life brighter.<br><br>
                You’ll always be loved, remembered, and deeply missed.

              <p>
                My dear little sister, Wambo,<br><br>
                Many times when I visited you in school, you would sense our presence from far, and you would scream with the excitement of seeing your loved ones — which made us always look forward to the next visit — oh, and of course with your favorite drink, Delamere yoghurt.<br><br>
                Though you could not speak to us with words, you always found your own way to communicate — through your radiant smile, your laughter, and the light in your eyes. We always had a way we communicated and understood each other.<br><br>
                I remember those moments when you would protest whenever we tried to change your TV program at home, because you knew exactly what you wanted — and you made sure we followed your lead — and we loved you all the more for it.<br><br>
                On that very day which remains vivid, we saw you from a distance — quiet, peaceful — and for a moment, we waited to hear your familiar scream of excitement, the one that always filled our hearts whenever we came to visit. But this time, there was silence. You were already resting, deeply asleep in God’s loving arms.<br><br>
                Today, as we say goodbye, our hearts are full of gratitude. We thank God for the beautiful years He allowed us to share with you. The laughter we shared, the talks, and the quiet moments in between are memories I’ll hold close forever. You had a way of making everything feel lighter.<br><br>
                We shall miss you dearly, our baby girl.<br><br>
                Sleep peacefully in God’s embrace.
