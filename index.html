                Wambo our beautiful, jovial, and ever-smiling baby girl, for the 32 years you have been in our lives, you have brought sunshine in our home. Your presence, and your quiet strength has filled our home with warmth and meaning. You have been our precious gift, our joy, and a constant reminder of love's power.<br><br>

                Though caring for you came with its challenges, you never were a burden. Through you, we learned patience, compassion, and the purest form of love.<br><br>

                Though you could not speak, you understood the language of love better than anyone else. Your eyes spoke where words could not and your smile answered every time we called your name now only memories echo where your laughter once lived.<br><br>

                Every night before you slept, it was always the same:<br>
                “God loves you, Wambu. Jesus loves you. Dad loves you. Mummy loves you. Goodnight, Wambu.”<br>
                And now, sweet girl, it is an eternal Good night.<br><br>

                You have finished your race and now rest in the loving arms of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ — free, whole, and at peace.<br><br>

                Fare thee well, beautiful angel.<br>
                You will forever be our baby Gal,<br>
                Your love will forever live in our hearts.<br>

                Our sweet and loving sister, you were a beautiful soul and such a lovable sister. Your giggles said more than words could. We felt your warmth every time we came to visit you in school and even when you were home. We shall forever treasure this great memories and hold them dear to our hearts.<br><br>
                
                Growing up, we would watch our parents taking care of you, we would see the love and the dedication. This taught us that caring for you was not a burden but a blessing, it taught us to be there for each other, a lesson we shall always hold dear to our hearts.<br><br>
                
                Sis, you may have been quiet but your presence spoke volumes. We will always remember your smile and the way you made our hearts lighter by being there. Forever grateful for the memories we made.<br><br>
                
                Goodbye our sister, you will always be loved, remembered, and greatly missed.<br>

                My dear little sister, Wambo,<br><br>
                Many times when I visited you in school, you would sense our presence from far, and you would scream with the excitement of seeing your loved ones which made us always look forward to the next visit oh, and of course with your favorite drink, Delamere yoghurt.<br><br>
                Though you could not speak to us with words, you always found your own way to communicate — through your radiant smile, your laughter, and the light in your eyes. We always had a way we communicated and understood each other.<br><br>
                I remember those moments when you would protest whenever we tried to change your TV program at home, because you knew exactly what you wanted and you made sure we followed your lead and we loved you all the more for it.<br><br>
                On that very day which remains vivid, we saw you from a distance quiet, peaceful and for a moment, we waited to hear your familiar scream of excitement, the one that always filled our hearts whenever we came to visit. But this time, there was silence. You were already resting, deeply asleep in God’s loving arms.<br><br>
                Today, as we say goodbye, our hearts are full of gratitude. We thank God for the beautiful years He allowed us to share with you. The laughter we shared, the talks, and the quiet moments in between are memories I’ll hold close forever. You had a way of making everything feel lighter.<br><br>
                We shall miss you dearly, our baby girl.<br><br>
                Sleep peacefully in God’s embrace.
